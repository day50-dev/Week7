This is a fork of kilo code. Here's the goals:
 - [ ] Maintain clean mergeability with kilo code  
 - [ ] Auditable, re-entrant, transferrable, forkable conversation flows (see [dejaview](https://github.com/kristopolous/dejaview))
 - [ ] deep git integrations with blame, branch, and issue analysis (via langchain)
 - [ ] fixes all the usability problems with model selection with price and context windows
 - [ ] allows for multiple models to be used as a cascade or run simultaneously for llm arena style swapping (part of dejaview)
 - [ ] provide conversational ids and exposure to other applications (deja)
 - [ ] interface debuggers and observability tools (via litellm)
 - [ ] remote system execution (via llmehelp/shellwrap)
 - [ ] permit for it to be api/able and surfaceable outside of vscode (server mode)

At the same time pulling down from kilo code and fixing the outstanding bugs in their github.
