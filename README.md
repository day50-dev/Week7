This is a fork of kilo code. Here's the goals:

 - [ ] fixes all the usability problems with model selection with price and context windows
 - [ ] allows for multiple models to be used as a cascade
 - [ ] provide conversational ids and exposure to other applications
 - [ ] interface debuggers and observability tools
 - [ ] remote system execution
 - [ ] permit for it to be api/able and surfaceable outside of vscode (server mode)

At the same time pulling down from kilo code and fixing the outstanding bugs in their github.
